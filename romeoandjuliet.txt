<h3>ACT I</h3>
<h4>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h4>
<p><em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</em></p>

<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
<p><strong>GREGORY:</strong> No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> I mean, and we be in choler, we'll draw.</p>
<p><strong>GREGORY:</strong> Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
<p><strong>GREGORY:</strong> But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
<p><strong>GREGORY:</strong> To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.</p>
<p><strong>GREGORY:</strong> That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPSON:</strong> True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</p>

<p><em>They continue speakingâ€¦</em></p>
